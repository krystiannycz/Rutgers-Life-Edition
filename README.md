# Rutgers-Life-Edition
This program is a text adventure game based on the everyday life of a Rutgers student. It can be used as an orientation game for new incoming freshmen and transfer students. The purpose of this program is to help new students familiarize themselves with the average day-to-day commute to their classes here at Rutgers. It simulates an average day of a student, starting in Livingston Campus. The user would then take a bus to the campus they need to go to. The user would also have to find which building their class is located in. The user would then go to class, receive a report on how efficiently they travelled around the campus for the day, and then the game would end.
