* Welcome to Life: Rutgers Edition *

In order for this program to work, you must first create a new java project folder on Eclipse.

You may name the folder whatever you want.

Then, you must create a class with the name, "Game", and delete everything on there.

Along with that, you must create an empty text file called "performance.txt".

Then, you must click and drag the performance.txt file into the project folder in Eclipse containing the Game class.

Then, you must open the Game.java file in the zipped folder, copy the code, and paste it in the Game class on Eclipse.  

Once you have completed those steps, you may run the code and answer the questions on the console.

When the code has finished running, click on the performance.txt file in the project folder to see your results.

We hope you enjoy!
